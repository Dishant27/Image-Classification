# Image Classification using Tensorflow and Keras
Image Classification is a Machine Learning module that trains itself from an existing dataset of multiclass images and develops a model for future prediction of similar images further classifiying them to specific Category or Object. In this Project we have used CIFAR10 Dataset ro train and then validate our Model developed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The testing is done on custom or images provided by the user.

## What is CNN?
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vison that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).
